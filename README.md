# Instructions
This is a personal repository containing my Arch Linux setup and configurations. Feel free to explore and use it as a reference for your own setup.

## Config Files
These are generally located in the `~/.config/` directory. You can copy them to your own system to replicate my setup.

### Zsh Config
My Zsh configuration file, `.zshrc`, is included here. You can place it in your home directory (`~/.zshrc`).

## KDE Setup
These are generally located in `~/.config` directory as well. For more specific instructions on setting up KDE, please refer to the [kde-config.md](kde-config.md) file in this repository.

## Obsidian Vault
My obsidian configurations, themes, and plugins. Place them in `.obsidian` of your Obsidian vault directory.

## VsCode Settings
My VSCode settings and extensions. Place them in the appropriate VSCode configuration directories.

They are generally located in:
- Settings: `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`
- Keybindings: `~/.config/Code/User/keybindings.json`
- Profiles: `~/.config/Code/User/profiles.json`
- Snippets: `~/.config/Code/User/snippets/`

### Hsnips Snippets
My custom Hsnips snippets for VSCode is located in
`~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/draivin.hsnips`

## Scripts
This repository also contains various scripts that I use for system maintenance and automation. You can find them in the `Scripts/` directory.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to back up your existing configurations before replacing them with mine.
- Some configurations may require additional dependencies or software to work correctly.
- I use timeshift for system backups, so consider setting it up for your own system.
- Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance with the setup.
- Enjoy your Arch Linux experience!
